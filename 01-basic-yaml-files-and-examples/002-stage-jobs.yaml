# You can organize your pipeline into jobs. Every pipeline has at least one job. 
# A job is a series of steps that run sequentially as a unit. 
# In other words, a job is the smallest unit of work that can be scheduled to run.



##A few key considerations when we are talking about jobs:

#Job names must be unique in a given stage....more on that in a minute
#Variables can be loaded to the scope of the job
#Every pipeline must have at least one job
#The agent OS can be defined at the job level
#By default, jobs are run in parallel. Can override by dependsOn[ job name]
#Must have at least one job with no dependencies
#Deployment jobs are a key concept
#Azure DevOps Environments are a deployment job property. Next post forthcoming.
