# This YAML configuration defines an Azure Pipelines pipeline with two stages: 'car' and 'byke'.
# Each stage contains two jobs:
#   - Stage 'car': jobs 'car-latest' and 'car-old'
#   - Stage 'byke': jobs 'byke-latest' and 'byke-old'
# Each job runs a single step that executes a shell command (echo) to print a specific message:
#   - 'car-latest', 'car-old', 'byke-latest', or 'byke-old'
